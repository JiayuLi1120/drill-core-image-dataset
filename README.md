# Dataset Card for Drill Core Image Dataset (DCID)

## Dataset Details

### Dataset Description

The Drill Core Image Dataset (DCID) is a large-scale benchmark designed for lithology classification based on RGB core images. It provides two primary versions:

- **DCID-7**: 7 lithology categories with 5,000 images per class.
- **DCID-35**: 35 lithology categories with 1,000 images per class.

All original images are 512×512 pixels in resolution. Each category is split into training and testing subsets in an 8:2 ratio. Additional variants are generated by resizing to smaller resolutions (32, 64, 128, 256) and applying real-world data augmentation (RWDA) to simulate image imperfections.

## Uses

### Direct Use

This dataset is intended for:
- Training and evaluation of lithology classification models.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The dataset was created to address the lack of publicly available, high-resolution lithology image benchmarks for deep learning research in geoscience.

### Source Data

#### Data Collection and Processing

- All images were obtained from scanned or digitally photographed core sections during geological fieldwork.
- Images were labeled and verified by experienced lithologists.
- Slightly defective images (e.g. with stains, shadows, blur) were used for RWDA simulation.
- Downsampled versions were created using bilinear interpolation.

#### Who are the source data producers?

Field geologists and engineers involved in borehole drilling and core extraction during various exploration campaigns.

### Annotations

No additional annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, segmentation) are included. Each image is labeled with a single lithology category.

#### Annotation process

Lithology labels were determined and verified by domain experts using core logs and physical inspection. There was no crowdsourcing or automated labeling.

#### Who are the annotators?

Professional geologists and technical staff from participating institutions.

#### Personal and Sensitive Information

The dataset does not contain personal, sensitive, or private information.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

- Some lithologies are visually similar, which may challenge models.
- Natural class imbalance exists, especially in the 35-class version.
- Lighting and camera inconsistencies are partially simulated via RWDA but not fully representative of all field conditions.

### Recommendations

- Always validate model outputs with geological expertise.
- Perform robustness testing on RWDA variants to assess generalization.
- Use multi-resolution evaluation to understand model scaling behavior.
